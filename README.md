# IngredientScraper
Takes in recipe URL and scrapes the ingredients.
Typically recipes have a blog post before and can be annoying to get the ingredients.
Mostly made this to play around as a small project
Uses the metadata typically used for google recipe cards. 
Won the OpenSourcery hacktober best tool and UI!
